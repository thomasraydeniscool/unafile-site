## Background

Time and time again I had gone through the stuggle of programaticly converting files and it was always the same story.

- Setting up conversions locally was a nightmare. It always ended up being a 'hacky' mess that didn't work half the time.
- Conversion services were old, clunky, expensive, and built with ancient software so the quality of the conversion was a hit or miss.

One day, when going through the same grind, I asked a fellow developer what they used for converting files and they had sent me the same horrible, unsustainable code, I too was forced to write.

I kept telling myself that there must be a better way.

> "More developers must need to convert file formats too, it can't just be me, right?"

This is when unafile was born.

## Our mission

At unafile we strive to be the most dependable conversion API, an API that developers deserve.

Something as simple as converting a file format should just work, and that is our goal.
